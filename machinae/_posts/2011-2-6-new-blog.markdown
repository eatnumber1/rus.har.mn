title: New Blog
excerpt: Throwing out my old blog, I've constructed a new and better one.
---

I decided to throw out my old blog and build a new one that uses Github's
[pages](http://pages.github.com/). I have migrated the posts which I found to be
particularly interesting, but the complete old blog can be found on
[Blogger](http://eatnumber1.blogspot.com/)

This new blog is pretty cool because it uses
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) to generate static html pages for
the site. Jekyll is an interesting take on web sites. I don't know if it is a
new idea, but it is new to me. What Jekyll does is statically generate html
pages using the [Liquid](https://github.com/tobi/liquid) templating engine.
I've found that for all of the common services for which you would want some
code running on the backend, there is a web service that can do it for you, and
all you have to do is throw some javascript in to the page. One example is
[Disqus](http://disqus.com/) which I am using to support commenting on blog
posts.
